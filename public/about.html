<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Michelle here! I've been programming for over 20 years now. I started my current position at World Class
  in May of 2001(man, I'm old) as a temp hire. I was doing paperwork, making copies, basically an assistant for
  a year or two before deciding I wanted to try my hand at coding. And I've been there ever since.

<p>When I am not deep in some code, I am the Uber driver for my 15 year old twins, hahaha! I am also a Realtor&copy;
  on the side which gets me out of the house.</p>
